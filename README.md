Channerics is a library of generic chan patterns for golang 1.18+.

## Sources and Credit
Many of these patterns are from around the web and from the book [Concurrency in Go](https://www.amazon.com/Concurrency-Go-Tools-Techniques-Developers/dp/1491941197), by Katherine Cox-Buday, to whom most credit should be given.
Learning concurrency in Go is a terrific way to learn the language and concurrency in general. I highly encourage grabbing a copy of the book!

This repo is a work in progress. Until you no longer see this message it is not fit for use.

## Contact
I'm actively looking for patterns to add to this library and accept solicitations.
