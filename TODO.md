## Stage one
1) The following patterns: OrDone, Fan Out/In, Cond, Tee, Bridge, Repeater, Generator, Or, Merge, Cancellation, Batcher
2) Tests (unit and race-detection)

## Stage two
1) First round cleanup and repo re-org
2) Other/advanced patterns: token bucket (rate limiting), buck wild stuff, etc.
3) Pop the hood for a while: build options, advanced settings, internal chan considerations/optimizations
4) Advanced change-propagation library? See old observables notes for reqs.

## Stage three
6) Concurrency at scale: context, healing, observability methods/tools/approaches/diagnostics.
